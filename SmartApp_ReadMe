 > Modify consumer behaviour towards saving water through gamification
 
 The main objective of this hackathon is to develop a practical solution that incentivizes consumer behaviour change to promote water conservation. By leveraging digital metering data, participants are encouraged to explore how turning conservation into a rewarding and engaging game can foster sustained changes in water usage habits. 
 
 The raw data consists of anonymised data from the European [SmartH2O project](https://zenodo.org/records/556725). The files in this repository provided a cleaned version fo  this data, ready for analysis.
 
 Further detail is available in the [Challenge Document](www/iwn-hackathon-2025-challenge.pdf)
 
 You can explore the data in an [interactive application](https://prevos.shinyapps.io/iwn-hackathon-2025/).
 
+### Streamlit smart water tracker
+
+This repository now also includes a Streamlit dashboard (`streamlit_app.py`) that lets households search for their smart meter ID,
+compare their daily usage with smart city and town benchmarks, review per-person efficiency scores, and unlock gamified challenges based on metadata and appliance insights.
+
+To launch it locally:
+
+```bash
+pip install -r requirements.txt
+streamlit run streamlit_app.py
+```
+
+The app reads the processed CSV files directly from `clean_data/clean_data.zip`, so no manual extraction is required.

 ## Files
 - `clean_data`: Cleaned data files (zipped file only on GitHub due to size limitations)
 - `raw_data`: Original data files from SmartH2O project
 - `LICENSE`: GPL 3 Free Software license
 - `README.md`: This file
 - `etl.R`: R Script to transform the raw data
 - `shiny-application.R`: Interactive application to explore the data
 
 ### Raw Data
 The SmartH2O project provides anonymised digital metering datasets from the towns of Terre Di Pedemonte and Valencia in Switserland and Spain. 
 
 Each dataset is stored in its named folder and contains: `anonymizer.zip`. Once decompressed, the archived files are `smarth2o_anonymized_households.csv` and `smarth2o_anonymized_consumptions.csv`
 
 ### Extract, Transfer & Load process
 The raw data is extracted and transferred with the `etl.R` script to create [tidy data](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html). The data is stored in three files:
 
 - `appliances.csv`: Count of water appliances for households
 - `houshold_meta_data.csv`: Meta data related to households
 - `meter_reads.csv`: Meter reads
 
 Due to GitHub size limitations, these files are provided in a ZIP archive: `clean_data.zip`.
 
 ### `meter_reads.csv`
 - `smart_meter_id`: The smart meter's unique ID. Starts with either T (Terre Di Pedemonte) or V (Valencia), followed by a three-digit number.
 - `timestamp`: Timestamp in local time.
